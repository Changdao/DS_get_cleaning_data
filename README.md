2. Read train set data subject_test.txt.  
3. Read train set y_test.  
4. Merge those three datasets.  
5. Do the above steps on the test sets.   
6. Merge the train set with test set.   
7. Aggregate the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
